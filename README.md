# Havell — Instant Quote MVP (Vercel + Vite + React) — v2

This v2 includes safer error handling to avoid blank screens when the API is unreachable, and it forces JSON headers on the API responses.

## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# OR run with serverless locally:
# vercel login
# vercel dev
```
Deploy to Vercel by importing this repo. The `/api` folder becomes Serverless Functions.
